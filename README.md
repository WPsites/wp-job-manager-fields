#### Add salary field to WP Job Manager plugin.

Using the example shown here https://github.com/Astoundify/wp-job-manager-fields I've modified the class to create a salary field.

The salary range inputs are also added to the search form.

Either upload this file as a plugin, include it in your own, or add it to a child theme. The inline documentation does a pretty solid job of explaining what is going on.
